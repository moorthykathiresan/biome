Do you know, one of your own sons is going to compete with you, misjudging you
driven by mother nature making an epic YANAM creating two more new Kingdoms? 
He will compete with you naturally, unintentionally with innocense; paving way of helping
good people in need on the way until your third son reveals the truth and reality to him.
You and everyone who knows this and involved in this will be distracted by MAYA (illusion) 
RECURSIVELY in a LOOP. Every thing happening on the way will help him to master his skills
such a way that he will be the King that everyone want to bless and cherish heartfully and
will have good life with. BOON!
MAYA will guide your third son to the reality. With Two new Kingdoms, one of them will be
GIVEN to him and the remaining will be with you and your other sons.
Greater Good Empire is on the way! Note: This epic writting is itself distracted a bit by MAYA! :)
